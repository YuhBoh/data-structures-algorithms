Algorithm: Set of instructions to solve a problem.

Time Complexity: Time taken by algorithm to run as input size grows.

Space Complexity: Memory/Storage algorithm requires to run as input size grows.

Both measured by "big O notation".

Big O notation
O(1): runtime constant regardless of size.
O(n): runtime grows linearly with input size.
O(n^2): runtime grows quadratically with input size.
